				We limit ourselves to collect the smallest amount of user data that we need in order to
				create a seamless experience when using Talk. This data includes:
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCIceCandidate" target="_blank">
					RTCICECandidates
				</a>
				&
				<a
					href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCSessionDescription"
					target="_blank"
				>
					RTCSessionDescription
				</a>
				which is needed to establish the video call using WebRTC. Also, both RTCICECandidates &
				RTCSessionDescription is not stored in any persistent database, it's removed from the server
				as soon as the user unjoins the call by closing the browser window.
			</p>
			<p>Talk is purely peer-to-peer, which means the user's video & audio is not sent to our server at all. We use Google Analytics to track
				aggregated usage statistics in order to improve our service.</p>

				The maker of Talk has no intention of using personally or selling any of the
				above-mentioned data.
